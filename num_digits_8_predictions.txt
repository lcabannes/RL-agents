Answer the question using a calculator in the following way:
    Input 'Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?'
    Output: 'In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 .
    Betty's parents gave her 15 .
    Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 .
    This means, Betty has (100 / 2) + (15 * 2) + 15.
    So, Betty needs 100 - ((100 / 2) + (15 * 2) + 15) to buy the wallet.'
